TODO – Project Workflow Redesign (Spec-Driven, No Human PO)

1. Replace the Product Owner role with a **Specification Authority**
   - Treat the technical specification as the single source of truth
   - The Specification Authority:
     - Defines which Themes (Now / Next / Later) are in scope
     - Defines which Epics and Features are eligible for story generation
     - Enforces non-negotiable constraints and invariants from the spec
     - Does NOT prioritize based on business opinion or simulate a customer
   - Any story that violates the spec is rejected deterministically

2. Story Generation (intentionally “good enough”)
   - Generate user stories from eligible Features only
   - Accept that initial stories can be mediocre but must be:
     - Spec-compliant
     - Persona-correct
     - Theme/Epic-consistent
   - Validate stories using:
     - Spec validator
     - Contract enforcer (theme, epic, persona, invariants)
   - Persist only contract-clean stories

3. Sprint Framing (no task breakdown yet)
   - Inputs:
     - Spec-approved stories
     - Sprint timebox / capacity
   - Outputs:
     - Sprint goal (derived from selected stories)
     - List of stories included in the sprint
   - No task decomposition at this stage

4. Team Simulation Agent (planning intelligence)
   - Simulates a development team to suggest:
     - Which story to start with
     - Ordering based on:
       - Risk
       - Dependencies
       - Unknowns
       - Shared setup / context
   - Does NOT break stories into tasks yet
   - Warns against unsafe parallelization

5. Just-In-Time Task Breakdown
   - After sprint start, and ONLY for the selected next story:
     - Break the story into tasks
     - Identify spikes and unknowns
   - Avoid global or speculative task decomposition

6. One-Story-at-a-Time Execution
   - Execute and complete the current story end-to-end
   - Validate acceptance criteria and contracts
   - Only after completion:
     - Select the next story
     - Perform its task breakdown

Goal:
A fully spec-driven, deterministic workflow that replaces subjective Product Owner decisions with a Specification Authority, while using agents only where reasoning and risk assessment genuinely add value.
