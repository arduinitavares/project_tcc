# Task Packet v1 Schema Reference

## Summary

Task Packet v1 is the original deterministic task-packet contract that shipped before the Task 3 split introduced `story_packet.v1` and promoted the live task endpoint to `task_packet.v2`.

This document is retained as a historical schema reference for the superseded v1 payload. It does **not** describe the active response shape of the live `/api/projects/{project_id}/sprints/{sprint_id}/tasks/{task_id}/packet` endpoint anymore.

For the active task endpoint contract, see [Task Packet v2 Schema Reference](./task-packet-schema-v2.md).

## Assembly Rules

### Identity and linkage
- A packet is valid only if the requested task belongs to a story and that story is linked to the requested sprint through `SprintStory`.
- The API must reject invalid task/sprint combinations instead of inferring context.

### Deterministic helper fields
- `packet_id` is deterministic and derived from the tuple `(schema_version, sprint_id, task_id)`.
- `label` is a deterministic display label derived from the task description.
- `vision_excerpt` is the first non-empty paragraph of product vision, truncated deterministically.
- `acceptance_criteria_items` are derived by normalizing the raw acceptance criteria text into ordered line items.

### Spec authority
- Task Packet v1 uses **story-pinned authority only**.
- If `accepted_spec_version_id` exists, the packet may expose relevant invariants from that exact compiled authority.
- If `accepted_spec_version_id` is missing, the packet must set the spec binding to `unpinned`.
- The packet must never silently fall back to the latest product authority.

### Scoped Constraints
- Task Packet v1 removes `relevant_invariants` to avoid polluting narrow task bounds with broad story-level architectural context.
- `task_hard_constraints` handles specific execution bounds for the task. In Phase 2 it is populated only from task-local metadata bindings (`relevant_invariant_ids`) resolved against the story's pinned compiled authority.
- `story_compliance_boundaries` is derived from the pinned compiled authority joined to invariant IDs referenced by alignment findings (`finding_invariant_ids`).
- If the compiled authority artifact is unavailable or unparsable, `authority_artifact_status` becomes `missing` and both constraint arrays remain empty.

### Structured task metadata
- Persisted tasks now carry canonical metadata in `Task.metadata_json`.
- The canonical metadata object is:
  - `version: "task_metadata.v1"`
  - `task_kind`
  - `artifact_targets`
  - `workstream_tags`
  - `relevant_invariant_ids`
- Existing tasks are backfilled one-way to the canonical empty metadata object.
- Unknown invariant IDs in task metadata are ignored during packet assembly and never promoted into `task_hard_constraints`.

### Validation freshness
- Validation freshness is based on the recomputed current story input hash versus the stored validation evidence input hash.
- `current` means the hashes match.
- `stale` means validation evidence exists but the hashes differ.
- `missing` means no validation evidence is present.

### Source fingerprint
- `source_fingerprint` must change when any of the following change:
  - task update
  - story update
  - acceptance criteria update
  - sprint update
  - sprint-story membership timestamp
  - validation evidence timestamp or input hash
  - task metadata hash
  - pinned spec version
  - compiled authority compilation timestamp
  - product update

## Sprint Planner Task Shape

Sprint planner decomposition now emits structured task objects, not plain strings:

```ts
type StructuredTaskSpec = {
  description: string;
  task_kind: "analysis" | "design" | "implementation" | "testing" | "documentation" | "refactor" | "other";
  artifact_targets: string[];
  workstream_tags: string[];
  relevant_invariant_ids: string[];
};
```

Validation rules:
- `description` must be non-empty.
- `task_kind` must use the allowed enum values.
- `artifact_targets`, `workstream_tags`, and `relevant_invariant_ids` are trimmed, deduped, and reject empty-string values.
- `relevant_invariant_ids` must be a subset of the parent story's `evaluated_invariant_ids`.

## Historical Endpoint Note

Task Packet v1 was originally returned by:

`GET /api/projects/{project_id}/sprints/{sprint_id}/tasks/{task_id}/packet`

That public endpoint now returns `task_packet.v2`. This file remains only as a historical record of the superseded v1 schema.

## Explicit Non-Goals

Task Packet v1 does **not** include:
- prompt text
- human brief text
- agent-flavor formatting
- roadmap dumps
- sibling task dumps
- target file guesses
- codebase hints not already modeled upstream

Those belong in later renderers or future schema extensions, not in the canonical v1 packet.
