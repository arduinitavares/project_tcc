# Repository Instructions

Use Context7 MCP for library or framework documentation, API reference, setup steps, version-specific behavior, and configuration guidance without waiting for an explicit request.

## Pull Request Reviews

When reviewing a pull request, always fetch and consider the existing PR comments before writing the review.

## Worktrees

If you create a temporary worktree for investigation, review, or implementation, remove it after you finish using it.

## Typing Style

Keep repo-level style guidance short, specific, and broadly applicable.
Prefer explicit annotations for important module-level values when the type matters for readability, review, or future agent edits.
When a file-level path banner is used, keep the repository-relative path as the first line of the file.

Prefer:
`logger: logging.Logger = logging.getLogger(name=__name__)`

Over:
`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`

Prefer:
`# utils/response_parser.py`

Followed by the module docstring and imports.

If a style rule grows beyond a small, reusable convention, move the detailed policy into tooling or a dedicated style document and keep `AGENTS.md` as the short entrypoint.
